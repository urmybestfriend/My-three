airshow!

I love airshows and military aircraft. the one featured here is an f-18. hopefully I will build some more military aircraft to assemble
some static displays! :D


notes:
- so when the f-18 controlled by the user reaches some vertical angle ( > 90 deg), the camera flips. not a big deal, but interesting.

  looks like the issue is with lookAt()
  this might help: https://discourse.threejs.org/t/solved-lookat-flips-cam-rotation-180-degrees-how-do-i-remove-this/2066/3
  and this: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/688

  this dicussion also looks interesting: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/1460

- a more pressing matter is the way I handle rolls with Q and E. i'm manipulating the actual jet's mesh so the axis can get misaligned relative
to the group object it's a child of, which then makes all my controls inverted. but it does make sense that that should happen but at 
the same time I'm not really sure what a proper experience should be like thinking about it more. maybe I'll reinstall BF2 and take a look :) 

- also, when I put the f18 in a group object the rolling behavior is exactly what i want. but when i try using just the f18 mesh itself,
  the rotation is not as good, i.e. it feels like there's some offset, rather than rotating the jet as if the z-axis was going through the 
  middle of it. not really sure why but that's something to look into.

todo:
- better lighting + clouds
- basic f-18 animations like:
	- flaps
	- rudders
	- landing gear deploy/retraction on key press
- allow user to switch between aircraft
- more camera modes
- make more planes for static displays! 
	-ideas: c-17, c-5, f-15, f-14 (even though retired lol), f-22, av-8b, p-8, tanks are good too, helicopters!!
