## dishwashing    
just a little idea I had. probably would be more fun in VR :)

some concepts I reviewed here are using raycasting to select and move items (which involves converting mouse 2d coords to 3d coords), animation (e.g. using AnimationMixer), dealing with SkinnedMeshes and bones.    
    
unfortunately I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to work with a bad model I exported from Blender (even though it looked fine in Don McCurdy's gltf viewer, animations and all) and ended up remaking my hand model.
