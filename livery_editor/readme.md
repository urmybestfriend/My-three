# livery_editor   
### a small demo that allows the editing of textures and creation of new livery for models

Features are limited since this is intended to be just a proof-of-concept. This could probably be extended though to include a more complete drawing/paintbrush tool and a smarter and/or easier way of editing textures perhaps.    
    
some other ideas:    
- is it possible to draw on the model itself? 
- can we achieve a mirroring effect on the model when drawing on a texture? 
- how about pasting images onto the texture like decals for plastic models?
