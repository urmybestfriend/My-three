## shaders

having fun with shaders. there's so much you can do with them! :O    
    
1. jet
- the color and position of vertices of the model changes based on time to create a bit of a "morphing" jet
    
2. jet2
- another jet model but this time featuring the Blinn-Phong reflection model
    
3. whale shark
- a colorful, glowing whale shark (the color (plus a bit of noise) changes over time on the white parts of the shark)
    
4. springy shards
- a bunch of rotating squares whose vertices and colors change over time to form a swirling pattern
- the squares are created using BufferGeometry and the shaders are attached to the BufferGeometry
    
5. raymarching
- a basic, minimal raymarching example
