notes:

You are a submarine tasked with providing underwater reconnaisance for the mother ship! 
Survey the ocean floor beneath the mother ship to find and disarm dangerous things, as well as to find and collect potentially useful things!

Be careful not to hit anything or else your submarine will get damaged. if you get damaged enough, you shall perish. :(
